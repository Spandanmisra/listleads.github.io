Protecting complex modern enterprises involves a continuous process of mapping and evaluating the IT estate, operational processes and the external business and regulatory landscape. Trained professionals are required to use a range of tools and techniques across vast and unique estates. Amidst all of this complexity, it is heartening to see enterprises putting a renewed focus on the basics.</p>\n<p>Cyber hygiene is a term that is becoming fashionable again, and for good reason. Fundamental practices like deleting redundant accounts, scanning for vulnerabilities and updating software versions are just as crucial as ever and risk being lost in the increased activity of managing larger estates. The fundamentals of security are as important as ever, so protecting the modern corporate landscape starts with applying cyber hygiene at scale.</p>\n<p>Security risks often start life as poor cyber hygiene. Passwords stored in cleartext, incorrect patch management, anonymous access enabled to LDAP. Every organisation that collects data will always need to get the fundamentals right. The elite ones are now beginning to extend the practice further.</p>\n<h3>Introducing risk hunting</h3>\n<p>Multiple layers of checks and balances are present in the enterprise security apparatus. IT and security teams are doing their job of managing cyber hygiene, boards are providing oversight and investment, but there will still be unassigned risk. This needs to be proactively identified.</p>\n<p>Addressing this unassigned risk requires a new form of security oversight that we call Risk Hunting. Risk Hunting adds proactive searching for Indicators of Risk (IoR) on top of the ongoing cyber hygiene work. It takes the concept of Continuous Control Monitoring (CCM) and layers in a deep understanding of business processes and cyber risk appetite. Identifying these new risks allows the security team to absorb them back into the cyber hygiene process, providing enhanced protection that reduces the disproportionate reliance on detection.</p>\n<p>Risk hunting is like committing to healthy lifestyle choices. It is possible to ignore best practice on sleep, diet and exercise, instead relying on weekly trips to the doctor to detect health problems. The result is that your health risk profile will rise, your costs will increase dramatically by addressing issues further down the funnel and you are wholly reliant on detecting illness after the fact.</p>\n","fieldGroupName":"Post_Article_FlexibleContent_Text","section":{"backgroundColour":"transparent","borderBottom":"default","borderTop":"default","classname":null,"fieldGroupName":"section","id":null}},{"fieldGroupName":"Post_Article_FlexibleContent_Blockquote","quote":"An exercise regime is a lot cheaper than a triple bypass in the long run.","section":{"backgroundColour":"transparent","borderBottom":"default","borderTop":"default","classname":null,"fieldGroupName":"section","id":null}},{"content":"<p>In cyber security, an increasing reliance on detection has led to growth in solutions such as Managed Detection and Response, and Threat Hunting. This has been a boon for the industry as a whole, but over-emphasising them to the exclusion of prevention equates to a focus on the symptoms, rather than addressing the underlying cause. An exercise regime is a lot cheaper than a triple bypass in the long run.</p>\n<p>Risk hunting is a frame of mind and an attitude, without which the associated tools and dynamic data become just another security cost. However, as the team grows and incorporates these layers into a culture of risk hunting, it provides enterprises with an early warning system that can root out IoRs early, prioritising and addressing them before they cause lasting damage.</p>\n<h3>The benefits of a happy hunting ground</h3>\n<p>Investing in risk hunting allows organisations to achieve a deeper understanding of security posture and reduce their costs. Hunters catch control failures before they become incidents and project future exposure by identifying new risks before the need for new controls is even recognised.</p>\n<p>This minimises the time between a potential control failure and the correction of this control. Doing risk hunting right means treating control failures as security incidents and ensuring that they are prioritised and addressed just as quickly. The prevailing culture in security is for SOC and incident response teams to spring into action when a diagnosis is confirmed; we need to treat the security equivalent of poor diet or lack of exercise with the same urgency.</p>\n<h3>Creating a hunting ground</h3>\n<p>Existing security risk data within enterprises could fill data lakes, so tools are needed to support risk hunters. Priority risks can change on a daily basis, so the data used needs to be current and dynamic. New risks emerge in areas without existing controls, so risk hunters need to be broadly skilled with visibility across all areas of the business. Enterprises can either build a risk hunting team or look to partner with their Managed Security Provider, although the current focus on detection means expertise is still more difficult to find than it should be.</p>\n<p>Frameworks and analytical tools are a necessary element to getting this right, but they are not sufficient. The job of “graduate risk hunter” does not exist. Tradecraft and operational expertise are also needed to get to grips with this multidisciplinary approach to making enterprises safer and more efficient.</p>\n<p>Cyber hygiene is as old as security, but the expansion to risk hunting is just starting to gain momentum. Most boards have not heard of Risk Hunting yet, but with every breach and GDPR fine they will be hunting for a solution before long. Expect to see more enterprises shift their budget towards risk hunting in the next two years.</p>\n","fieldGroupName":"Post_Article_FlexibleContent_Text","section":{"backgroundColour":"transparent","borderBottom":"default","borderTop":"default","classname":null,"fieldGroupName":"section","id":null}}],"image":{"id":"cG9zdDoxNzY3","altText":"","caption":null,"localFile":{"extension":"jpeg","publicURL":"/static/64e189245c742dd27b3f07f541641775/1576600558578.jpeg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/64e189245c742dd27b3f07f541641775/876a0/1576600558578.jpg","srcSet":"/static/64e189245c742dd27b3f07f541641775/53c59/1576600558578.jpg 750w,\n/static/64e189245c742dd27b3f07f541641775/64b93/1576600558578.jpg 1080w,\n/static/64e189245c742dd27b3f07f541641775/876a0/1576600558578.jpg 1082w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/64e189245c742dd27b3f07f541641775/3970f/1576600558578.webp 750w,\n/static/64e189245c742dd27b3f07f541641775/90a5d/1576600558578.webp 1080w,\n/static/64e189245c742dd27b3f07f541641775/1cb1f/1576600558578.webp 1082w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6654343807763401}}}},"intro":null,"podcast":{"fieldGroupName":"podcast","image":null,"podcast":null},"readwatchlistenTime":"5 minutes","summary":"The best modern security professionals are comfortable in complexity.","type":"article","video":{"fieldGroupName":"video","image":null,"video":null},"whitepaper":{"fieldGroupName":"whitepaper","fileThumbnail":null}},"authorDatabaseId":1,"authorId":"dXNlcjox","content":null,"databaseId":1766,"date":"2021-12-19T08:17:12","dateGmt":"2021-12-19T08:17:12","desiredSlug":null,"enclosure":null,"excerpt":"","featuredImage":null,"featuredImageDatabaseId":null,"featuredImageId":null,"guid":"/?p=1766","id":"cG9zdDoxNzY2","isContentNode":true,"isRevision":false,"isSticky":false,"isTermNode":false,"link":"https://prevalent.ai/resources/shhh-im-hunting-cyber-risks/","modified":"2021-12-19T08:19:04","modifiedGmt":"2021-12-19T08:19:04","pingStatus":"open","pinged":null,"postFormats":{"nodes":[]},"slug":"shhh-im-hunting-cyber-risks","status":"publish","terms":{"nodes":[{"id":"dGVybTo1OA=="}]},"title":"Shhh!

But cyber risk management is a more recent innovation.</p>\n<p>It is recently that early adopters have started to apply quantitative methodology to cyber risk management problems with rigour. The approach is starting to catch on, moving beyond a core group of technical innovators towards adoption by the broader business community.</p>\n<p>Over the last year several management consultancies have begun advocating for components of cyber risk management. These companies act as a bellwether for contemporary corporate strategy, so it is a reassuring to see them taking steps towards establishing cyber risk management as common practice, even if they still have some way to go. Let’s take a look at some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/publications/2019/are-you-spending-enough-cybersecurity.aspx\">BCG</a> recommends that organisations quantify their risk appetite, the first step towards building defences based on measurable risk</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/governance-insights-center/library/boards-guide-to-NIST-cybersecurity-framework.html\">PwC</a> highlights the value of applying a methodology (NIST CSF) focused on risk to security decisions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/insights/topics/risk-management/cyber-security-threats.html?icid=dcom_promo_featured|uk;en\">Deloitte</a> encourages companies to conduct asset inventories and prioritise investment in protecting “crown jewels”</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_us/trust-by-design/5-actions-to-achieve-adaptive-risk-management\">EY</a> recommends embedding risk and compliance functions within product and security to improve overall cyber resilience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are all useful tactics, but in isolation they are still a far cry from cyber risk management. It is almost as if a company would need some consultants to turn these into a coherent strategy.</p>\n<p><u>A promising effort</u></p>\n<p>The latest publication from <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-risk-based-approach-to-cybersecurity\">McKinsey</a> come the closest to offering a playbook for cyber risk management. The firm rejects “maturity-based” approaches to building cyber defences, where every conceivable tool, team and technique is slowly added, hoovering up budget and time while treating every asset as being of equal importance. Investing indiscriminately like this leads to waste and bureaucracy that hamstring even generous security budgets. Companies that prioritise their investment to protect their most valuable assets perform better regardless of the threat landscape or security tactics.</p>\n<p>The authors call for companies to prioritise spending allocation based on return on investment, and to map their enterprise risk ecosystem across the organisation. Again, full marks for proposing a rigorous system that allows for a quantitative, risk-based approach. Coupling this with a cyber risk appetite that is defined at board level and rigorously implemented creates a necessary foundation to implement cyber risk management.</p>\n<p><u>From Theory to Implementation </u></p>\n<p>The article presents the case for moving from security by maturity to a risk-based approach, but it does not address some of the necessary steps for this to happen. Fundamental to this is the capability to quantify risks on a continuous basis. Quantifying risks before, during and after cyber investment is the only way to accurately measure ROI, which is at the heart of a risk-based approach to cybersecurity. Anything less than this is just a different variation of the maturity approach.</p>\n<p>The article also slips up by recommending the use of a risk grid. While the authors’ cyber expertise is apparent, this was compromised by an approach that simplifies the process to the point of obscuring the data. The grid presents impact and likelihood scores with qualitative factors in a matrix to map against risk appetite.</p>\n<p>The result is a semi-quantitative risk analysis, which offers a sense of completeness and correctness that is completely divorced from the underlying factors. David Vose gives a detailed description of why this is a bad idea <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/semi-quantitative-risk-analysis-other-absurdities-david-vose/\">here</a>, but, in short, the value it offers is more false sense of security than calibrated cyber risk management. More importantly, it prevents us from finding the measurable ROI that is needed by the very executives these consultancy firms are targeting as an audience.</p>\n<p><u>Inflection point for cyber risk management</u></p>\n<p>Like many of our favourite bands, there is a danger that as cyber risk management enters the mainstream it will dilute the values that make it meaningful. This could mean embracing risk scoring based on semi-quantitative metrics, or applying a veneer of risk jargon to maturity-based programmes that ultimately amount to box ticking. Maintaining the status quo is easier than challenging it; overworked and understaffed security teams can more easily reclaim a work-life balance when they must only populate a cyber risk RAG or subjective scale diagram. It takes a lot more thought to build quantitative frameworks and implement a system for communicating these results to senior management, but the extra effort is worth it.</p>\n<p>We expect cyber risk management to continue its growth and adoption, but not everything that uses that name will have earned the right.</p>\n","databaseId":1649,"date":"2019-10-15T08:57:09","dateGmt":"2019-10-15T07:57:09","desiredSlug":null,"enclosure":null,"excerpt":"<p>Risk management for companies has been around since the creation of insurance in the 18th century, and cyber security has existed since computers were first password-protected in the 1960s.

Patch a device? How about spell Kubernetes?</p>\n<p>It is fair to say that the board won’t be configuring company firewalls any time soon, but security is an increasing concern for them. Government research found that the number of FTSE350 board members who consider cyber risk to be of high importance <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-governance-health-check-2018\">tripled between 2013 and 2018</a>. This change is far more likely to have increased stress and blood pressure than improved technical expertise at board level. The next wave of security technology should address the need for executive input by focusing on describing security as a business risk and providing Return on Investment (ROI) metrics to beleaguered board members.</p>\n<p>So says the latest Forrester report, “<a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/blogs/top-security-technology-trends-in-2019-transforming-the-future-of-work-in-security/\">The Top Security Technology Trends to Watch, 2019</a>”, and we wholeheartedly agree with them. The report is well worth a read, particularly their prediction that tailored security dashboards will be developed to “transform budgeting from an art to a science.” As boards take a firmer grip on security, they will rightly expect their CISOs to provide quantitative data to justify their budgets. And these same CISOs will be eager to present their own achievements back in terms that the board can understand, the language of business risk.</p>\n<p><u>What is security risk?</u></p>\n<p>Security risk is the risk of financial loss, disruption or reputational damage to an organisation resulting from a failure in its data or physical security measures. It is different from other operational risks due to the volume, velocity and variety (3Vs) of data processed by the modern enterprise, as well as the complexity of the IT systems.</p>\n<p>Until recently, security risk was addressed by organisations through the application of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) software tools. These products introduced security teams to the concept of security as a form of business risk, rather than individual threats and vulnerabilities. They continue to provide capabilities relevant to security, but they are built for a world of qualitative risks and lack the analytical firepower to offer a comprehensive and continuous view of security risk for today’s data volumes and variety.</p>\n<p>The arrival of security ratings services has familiarised the concept of security risk. They offer a view of security risk using data external to an organisation, shining the light on vendors and dramatically improving supply chain security. They added a necessary outside-in perspective, but they only focus on external data. Security ratings, like GRC software, are a crucial input into a single view of security risk, but they are not enough. More data sources are needed, and they need to be automated.</p>\n<p><u>The risk partnership</u></p>\n<p>The Forrester research argues that companies need a solution with customised inputs and a tailored dashboard to capture the wide range of security risks facing the modern enterprise.</p>\n<p>As a prediction, we think this is too conservative.</p>\n<p>It is not possible to accurately measure a company’s security risk just by modifying inputs and tweaking the visualisation. No two companies are alike, no matter how similar they seem. Business risks vary between companies, and this applies particularly to security risk.</p>\n<p>Configuring a platform to measure a company’s unique security risk and gauge ROI requires a deep partnership between a vendor and customer. Vendors need to walk in their shoes, get a feel for their culture and work environment, align it to their stated risk appetite. Accurate risk also requires a continuous view of security data: it’s no longer acceptable to show the board the company’s exposure from last week.</p>\n<p>Boards can add real value when they are presented with security decisions framed in business risk, based on up to date data and adjusted for company specific risk appetite. Getting there is a lot easier than waiting for board members to become security experts, but it will take more than tailored dashboards.

Companies set new global spending records <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/cybersecurity-spend-tops-us%2410-billion-in-q4-2018-as-new-deployment-models-gain-traction\">with $37 billion</a>invested in security in 2018, with expectations to surpass £42 billion by 2020. Gartner research found that <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/publications/2019/are-you-spending-enough-cybersecurity.aspx\">security spending per employee doubled between 2012 and 2018</a>. And yet the bad guys are still gaining the upper hand. <a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-gb/solutions/lp/economics-cybercrime.html\">Cybercrime cost the world economy $600 billion in 2017</a>, up from $500 billion in 2014 and growing quickly. People are starting to question whether increasing budgets reduces reduce cyber incidents.</p>\n<p>The problem is not lack of awareness either. UK Government research has found that the perceived importance of cyber risk among FTSE350 companies <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-governance-health-check-2018\">has almost tripled in five years</a>, proving that the most powerful decision makers in UK business are concerned about security. Nor is the UK an outlier, as the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2019\">2019 WEF Global Risk Report</a>has cyber-attacks occupying the fourth and fifth spots for international risks most likely to increase.</p>\n<p>When we rule out investment and intent as the reasons behind our collective failure at security, we are left with implementation. Is there something wrong with the way that well-meaning professionals are investing growing security budgets that is preventing us from improving our cyber resilience?</p>\n<p>The first thing to consider is how cyber defences are formed. A company’s security apparatus typically grows iteratively, with employees, tools and procedures added in response to changing budget, threats and regulations. It is easier in the short-term to deal with emergent threats reactively rather than revisit the entire security strategy. Over time this has led to an excessive number of tools, many of them point solutions, and this progresses into security teams that are overwhelmed by alerts, lacking a cohesive strategy and in a constant state of firefighting.</p>\n<p>Addressing this vicious circle requires an adaptive framework that is agreed by a company’s senior management and implemented across the organisation. The most effective approach to this is to apply a structured cyber risk management framework, where security threats are expressed in terms of financial risk to a business and cost of mitigation. When used correctly it leads to security spending being informed by risk specialists in the C-suite such as the CFO, CRO and even CEO. The next progression to make spending more efficient is to track the return on investment in cyber defences, to allow companies to better prioritise investment and provide more accurate reporting on their security posture.</p>\n<p><u>From risk management to ROI</u></p>\n<p>Cyber risk management comes from a philosophy of oversight that demands metrics to inform decisions as well as to assess them in retrospect. Security has historically struggled with this concept, as CISOs who have not suffered major incidents are unable to make the case for greater investment, and those who weathered breaches and attacks are forced to pay “security penance” and overspend in the aftermath. Measuring ROI resolves both situations.</p>\n<p>The first step to measuring ROI is to quantify security risks. One approach to this is to use a Value at Risk (VaR) approach, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis_of_information_risk\">FAIR framework</a>. The results of the quantification can then be represented in a loss exceedance curve. These plot the likelihood of sustaining a loss in a given year against the financial cost that would be sustained. In other words, the loss exceeded by an event compared with the chances of that event taking place.</p>\n<p>The second step is to compare the forecast losses against a company’s agreed risk appetite, enabling the organisation to decide where to invest in mitigations to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Finally, once these mitigations have been successfully implemented, the same risks are then quantified again using the VaR approach, comparing before and after, in order to assess the return on investing in the mitigations. This is best illustrated using a Loss Exceedance Curve.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-567\" src=\"https://prevalent.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Loss-Exceedance-curve-300x200.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p>\n<p>The above example of a Loss Exceedance Curve can be used determine ROI on an investment in security. This is done by plotting the inherent risk before the investment took place, using a VaR model to quantify it, and then comparing it with the agreed Risk Tolerance. If the risk is above the tolerance, then after any mitigations are in place the risk is calculated again. The before and after curves are then compared to determine ROI.</p>\n<p>Only a quantitative approach such as this can ensure budgets are spent in the most effective way, with the highest impact investments. It prevents reactive spending by building oversight into the investment process, and taps into senior expertise by presenting security in the language of business and risk. This approach can then be used to continuously monitor security projects as they progress, both through implementation and then over time once they are live.</p>\n<p><u>ROI requires continuous quantitative data</u></p>\n<p>Most organisations rely heavily on static tests such as vulnerability scans and penetration tests to determine cyber risk; these are useful exercises but are not enough in themselves.</p>\n<p>Qualitative assessments based on subjective factors, another common approach, often do more harm than good when measuring ROI. Some CISOs protest that quantitative data is not always available and soft scoring can provide a “feel” for security posture, but these methods rarely alleviate a lack of data in a highly complex field, while they can often obscure it.</p>\n<p>Dynamic, quantitative data is required to provide boards and executives with the information needed to make informed decisions about security investment.  This quantitative data needs to be up to date. As ESG’s Jon Oltsik explains in <a href=\"https://www.esg-global.com/blog/cyber-risk-management-disconnect-between-business-and-security\">Oltsik’s Law</a>, you cannot measure a dynamic environment with static data. Risk scoring, and resulting Return on Investment analysis, need to be based on continuously updated data.</p>\n<p><u>Risk in real terms</u></p>\n<p>UK government research shows that just one in three FTSE350 companies has even agreed security risk appetite and communicated it to staff. And that is based on self-reporting, the real number is likely to be lower. There is still a lot more waste than measurement in security. Yet it is clear that change is underway, with <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-03-05-gartner-identifies-the-top-seven-security-and-risk-ma\">Gartner naming risk appetite statements</a> as one of its top seven security and risk management trends for 2019.</p>\n<p>Cyber resilience is a moving target, and sometimes it can be hard to tell if a company is even moving in the right direction. Determining ROI allows for tangible, clearly defined measurement of progress that is understood throughout the organisation. For some companies this means demanding continuous risk reporting on security initiatives with full board oversight, while others might start by progressing from qualitative heat maps to quantifiable risk metrics.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal of cyber ROI is to maximise investment and reduce risk. This includes tapping into the expertise of the board and building towards a shared language of risk and ROI, which can only be done when risk and ROI are accurately and continuously measured. When done correctly, the value of security investment is plain to see.</p>\n","databaseId":1642,"date":"2019-07-16T09:00:07","dateGmt":"2019-07-16T08:00:07","desiredSlug":null,"enclosure":null,"excerpt":"<p>Cyber security looks like a waste of money.

It evokes a dark and secretive world populated by precocious teens in hoodies, organised crime gangs and malevolent nation state actors. By contrast, business or “operational” risk brings to mind sensible people wearing dark suits and making the world a little less unpredictable and exciting for us all. To reduce cyber threats to operational risks may feel like pulling back the curtain on real life science fiction, but it allows us to address a concern that has been growing for business owners and corporate boards.</p>\n<p>Security threats have become more sophisticated and cyber defences have adapted to match this. Companies are targeting their investment to counter emerging threats, creating an arms race that has left some larger businesses deploying over 80 security tools on average. Many of these tools operate as black boxes with narrow applications, forcing corporate security teams to switch frequently between products to cobble together a piecemeal view of security.</p>\n<h3>Move from fear to clarity</h3>\n<p>This arms race towards greater complexity increases risk in the form of blind spots and human error, leading some companies to push back on the industry norm. Instead security tools should be flexible to allow for evolving threats, interoperable to remove blind spots, and grounded in a risk-based view to facilitate reporting to the board. Security as a technical problem is inherently impossible to solve outright, but as a business problem it can be neatly described in the trusted language of risk.</p>\n<p>Addressing cyber risks in the language of business rather than that of internet subculture brings it in line with other business priorities. This framing allows for assessment of return on investment and operational progress, while ensuring that the security team are given the recognition they deserve in the context of the company as a whole. It is a more nuanced and evolving risk than others, but a risk none the less.</p>\n<h3>The value of a new perspective</h3>\n<p>While cyber threats continue to grow and advanced hacking tools are commoditised and made broadly available, changes in the security risk profile should be accounted for and addressed in the context of the business as a whole. Changing the context of assessment can replace reactive spending with proactive investment; as with investment in financial markets, short-term cyber developments can appear overwhelming, while adopting a long-term outlook encourages sensible, strategic decisions.</p>\n<p>Resolving cyber security issues is complex and intellectually challenging; but that does not have to be the case for the people it affects at every level of the business. The recent surge of interest in cybersecurity at board level represents welcome progress. To make the most of this companies should provide a comprehensive view of their security posture as an operational risk. This allows board members to quantify and assess it, before adding value through their decisions based on language and processes that are familiar to them and more particular to the business.</p>\n<p>Simpler is safer when it comes to protecting your business. Simplify strategy by expressing threats as operational risks, simplify tools by ensuring they are flexible and easy to adapt, and simplify language by ditching cyber and talking about security. Just remember that simple is very different to easy.</p>\n","databaseId":92,"date":"2019-03-27T12:26:38","dateGmt":"2019-03-27T12:26:38","desiredSlug":null,"enclosure":null,"excerpt":"<p>The word “cyber” has always carried an illicit ambiguity.

The cybercrime industry could be worth $6 trillion by 2022 <a href=\"https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/\">according to some estimates</a>, and investors think that where there’s muck there’s brass. But like generals fighting the last battle, many investors are funding increasingly complex point solutions while buyers cry out for greater simplicity and flexibility.</p>\n<p>Addressing this problem requires a radical shift in focus rather than a change of course. Vendors and investors need to look beyond money and consider the needs of the end users.</p>\n<h3>More money, more problems</h3>\n<p>London’s Infosec recently included over 400 vendors exhibiting, while RSA in San Francisco boasted more than 600. And this only includes those with the marketing budgets and inclination to exhibit. One advisory firm <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-startups-analysis/under-threat-cyber-security-startups-fall-on-harder-times-idUSKBN1F62RW\">claims to track 2,500 security startups</a>, double the number of just a few years ago. Cheap money has created a raft of zombie companies with little chance of IPO or acquisition, along with an even greater number of headaches for CISOs trying to make sense of it all.</p>\n<p>The market is creaking from this trend, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-startups-analysis/under-threat-cyber-security-startups-fall-on-harder-times-idUSKBN1F62RW\">Reuters reporting</a> M&amp;A down 30% in 2017 even as VC investment increased by 14%. But the real pain is being felt by CISOs trying to integrate <a href=\"https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/03/30/too-many-cybersecurity-companies/\">upwards of 80 security solutions</a> in their cyber defences, as well as overworked analysts struggling to keep up. The influx of cash has also caused marketing budgets to spike, leading to a market where it is deemed acceptable for increasingly esoteric products to be promoted to CISOs as silver bullets.</p>\n<p>All of this feeds into a sense of “product fatigue”, where buyers are frightened into paying for the latest black box solution, only for their blood pressure to further spike when they find that they don’t have the necessary resources to deploy or support these tools. This situation does not benefit any of the parties – the overwhelmed CISO, the overly-optimistic investors or the increasingly desperate vendors who find themselves caught in limbo between funding rounds when their concepts weren’t fully baked to begin with.</p>\n<p>Addressing complex modern threats calls for sophisticated tools and products, but we cannot fight complexity with complexity. SOC teams cannot dedicate finite analyst capacity to an ever-expanding battery of tools. Fragmentation within the security suite weakens company defences and the industry as a whole, and the drain on analysts’ time detracts from crucial areas like basic resilience and security hygiene.</p>\n<h3>Platforms, not Products</h3>\n<p>The industry doesn’t need more products, companies or marketing hype. We need an overhaul of the whole approach to security solutions, not an improvement of components. Security should be built on platforms with a plug-and-play infrastructure that better supports buyers, connecting products in a way that isn’t currently possible.</p>\n<p>Such platforms should be flexible and adaptable, rewarding vendor interoperability while punishing niche solutions that cannot be easily adopted. This would lead to collaboration within the industry and create a focus on results for end users, rather than increasingly blinkered product road maps. Such platforms could act as a magnifying glass for innovation, providing a sandbox to benchmark new technologies and creating de facto security standards in the process.</p>\n<p>This move from proprietary architecture to open modular architecture is a hallmark of Clayton Christensen’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation\">Disruptive Innovation theory</a>, and it is long overdue within the security industry. Buyers will have greater control of their tech stacks, while vendors and investors will get to proof of concept faster and see greater efficiency within the market.</p>\n<p>One example of such a platform is Apache Metron, an Open Source Security platform which emerged from Cisco. Metron has been adopted by a number of major security providers and provides us with a glimpse of what the future of security should look like.</p>\n<p>Collaborating, creating industry standards, or making technologies Open Source does not mean vendors can’t make money; in fact the reverse is true. Customers will be more willing to invest in security solutions that they know are future proofed, that don’t come with the dreaded “vendor lock-in”, and that simplify rather than further complicate their architecture.</p>\n<p>Like all of security, there are varying degrees of risk and reward, but this approach is starting to look like the only logical future in an increasingly frothy, confusing and low ROI field. There will be a correction in the security market, whether it is in a month or a year. The fundamentals that will cause this are already evident, so there is an excellent opportunity to learn the lessons in advance and minimise the pain by contributing towards the platforms of the future.</p>\n<div class=\"post__tags\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article__share text-center\"><a class=\"btn bg--facebook btn--icon\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.prevalent.ai/resources/oh-no-not-another-security-product/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"btn__text\"><i class=\"socicon socicon-facebook\"></i>Share on Facebook</span></a></div>\n","databaseId":86,"date":"2018-08-10T12:24:08","dateGmt":"2018-08-10T11:24:08","desiredSlug":null,"enclosure":null,"excerpt":"<p>This article originally appeared in Dark Reading Money has poured into cybersecurity following high-profile breaches in recent years.

The skills acquired through experience in a field, what we refer to as tradecraft, has been associated with craftsmanship going back to the guilds of the middle ages, leading to the coining of the term.</p>\n<p>New developments in strategy and analysis might emerge occasionally to elevate expectations, but time and again it is the domain experts who properly integrate these innovations that consistently deliver.</p>\n<p>Tradecraft is what leads countless world leaders to stop off at London’s Savile Row for their suits. It is the reason Norway leads the world at the Winter Olympics with a population smaller than that of Barcelona. It is consistently synonymous with success across all human pursuits and while it can be supplemented, it cannot be replaced.</p>\n<h3>Security tradecraft</h3>\n<p>In cybersecurity, threats and vulnerabilities change on a daily basis, but the principles that underpin high level security expertise, the sector’s tradecraft, have been around for over a century.</p>\n<p>In the field of national security, tradecraft arguably began with Francis Walsingham, Spymaster to Elizabeth the First. Walsingham pioneered intelligence gathering, espionage and cryptography in his service of the monarch, averting a proposed Catholic rebellion and a potential Spanish invasion.</p>\n<p>National security developed throughout the twentieth century and the Cold War, going on to form the basis of information security tradecraft. The most advanced Security Data Science remains firmly rooted in tradecraft principles stretching back to the Victorian era.</p>\n<p>Mastering tradecraft in any field is a lifetime’s work, but determining its importance to protecting data is straightforward. It provides the first principles of security; identifying and evaluating assets, determining and categorising risks, and applying models and solutions. Tradecraft in cybersecurity is a mindset and a skillset that draws from domain expertise and emphasises situational awareness. Technology, in turn, provides tools that offer value according to their application.</p>\n<h3>Tradecraft in practice</h3>\n<p>This domain expertise requires a deep understanding of the cybercrime landscape within an organisation’s industry, as well as in IT more broadly. Experienced practitioners are able to spot patterns and draw conclusions on the bad guys’ mindset from disparate attacks across different sectors. They can evaluate assets from the perspectives of their owner and potential attackers, blending behavioural psychology with quantitative risk assessment.</p>\n<p>Tradecraft is what allows security professionals to position each improvement in attackers’ capabilities or increase in a company’s budget within a cyber mosaic, where computer networks and nodes are overlaid by human traits and biases. It even allows them to present recommendations to a company’s board in a way that the chief executive can understand and approve.</p>\n<h3>Tradecraft and technology</h3>\n<p>The Tradecraft mindset should dictate how a company actively monitors for threats, prepares for events and sets in place principles that allow for uncertainty in planning. This approach is often more important than the strength of a security team’s products and tools, and is applicable right across the security function.</p>\n<p>New technology such as machine learning is a boon to the industry, but it is not a silver bullet. To use a sporting comparison, investing in advanced technology is like buying the world’s best international football players to line out for your team, without putting in place a management team who can coach them to play together. We are all familiar with stories of sporting underdogs who beat well-resourced favourites against all odds, but we do not want this to be a team of hackers overcoming our (costly) defences. The most advanced solutions will offer subpar security unless they have been built and implemented from a basis of tradecraft.</p>\n<h3>Where to find it</h3>\n<p>Tradecraft talent is hard to come by and is growing in importance. LinkedIn data shows that 24% of corporate executives have financial experience and yet couldn’t prevent the 2008 crisis, so the 3% with cybersecurity experience have a mountain to climb to avert a growing cybersecurity menace. Organisations need to find and enable tradecraft experts to keep their reputations and customers safe.</p>\n<p>A lot is written about how AI technology is displacing human input across a number of sectors, but in other ways it is making expertise all the more valuable. As a company’s endpoints, data, tools and solutions grow exponentially, the central security strategy underpinning it becomes crucial.</p>\n<p>This strategy is designed with tradecraft and implemented by technology. For the majority of companies, staying safe means looking to the market for both.</p>\n<div class=\"post__tags\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article__share text-center\"><a class=\"btn bg--facebook btn--icon\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.prevalent.ai/resources/tradecraft-putting-the-security-back-into-cybersecurity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"btn__text\"><i class=\"socicon socicon-facebook\"></i>Share on Facebook</span></a></div>\n","databaseId":83,"date":"2018-04-02T12:22:58","dateGmt":"2018-04-02T11:22:58","desiredSlug":null,"enclosure":null,"excerpt":"<p>Experience and ability are two sides of the same coin in all areas of human performance, from art and sport to business and technology.

British codebreakers in Bletchley Park, most notably Alan Turing, famously shortened the war by breaking the Nazi’s Enigma Code. These academics went on to form the heart of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), bolstering the UK’s national security through a combination of Tradecraft and advanced mathematics, skills that were rare enough to provide a distinct advantage internationally.</p>\n<p>Over 70 years later, warfare takes place increasingly online. Nation states and guns for hire still launch attacks to disable infrastructure or seize strategic assets using sophisticated technology. But now the targets are information and intellectual property rather than bridges or ammo dumps. And this weaponry is now being enhanced by approaches such as machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI), first conceived of by Turing in his famous paper “<a href=\"https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf\">The Imitation Game</a>”, where he hypothesised an AI that could pass for human when answering a series of questions.</p>\n<h3>Data science as a weapon</h3>\n<p>In the modern battlefield corporate data is a valuable asset, which has caused the line between public and private actors in cyberwarfare to become increasingly blurred. This makes all businesses vulnerable to breaches enabled by AI enhanced attacks. The increasing sophistication of these incidents has meant that data theft has become <a href=\"https://www.kroll.com/en-us/global-fraud-and-risk-report-2018\">the most prevalent form of corporate fraud</a> for the first time, according to Kroll. The weapons are changing as well as the targets, with research from Webroot showing that some <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/webroot-cms-cdn/8115/1302/6957/Webroot_QTT_Survey_Executive_Summary_December_2017.pdf\">86% of security execs</a> now worry that hackers will use AI against them.</p>\n<p>In one example, a security professional opened an unimportant port and <a href=\"https://stvp-static-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/4859.pdf\">tracked over 100,000 unauthorised login attempts</a>, the first after just five minutes. Bad guys have been using automated attacks to access data for many years, and determining its value after the fact. These actors can now apply AI style principles to improve these attacks over time by gathering data, learning and iterating. A rules-based defence that tries to define problems in advance will be useless in the face of these varied and autonomous attacks.</p>\n<p>This new firepower of malicious actors means that the only way to successfully protect against such attacks is with an equally advanced defence, <a href=\"https://www.prevalent.ai/blogs/security-data-science-the-collaborative-defence-needed-to-protect-your-prize-assets/\">Security Data Science</a>. While the security benefits are clear, applied data science is not easy. Gartner found that <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3810968\">CIOs ranked AI as the hardest technology to implement</a>, followed by digital security; applying both without disrupting security operations is a considerable challenge.</p>\n<p>Ranking AI and security as separate technologies is incongruous; security is an ongoing process and data science is a tool. Automation is an essential element of Security Data Science that must be grounded in <a href=\"https://www.prevalent.ai/blogs/tradecraft-putting-the-security-back-into-cybersecurity/\">security tradecraft</a>, and is not an end in itself. Security professionals determine the problem that needs solving, then work with data scientists to see if existing models can be applied or whether a new one is necessary.</p>\n<p>Mathematical and technical expertise is required to assess algorithms for rates of detections and false positives, real time application and cost to resource. Data scientists developing supervised learning models will need to consider scalability from training data and decay rates, those using unsupervised models will typically have to assess and interpret results.</p>\n<p>These models begin to be of value when security experts apply them according to a strategy that addresses existing threat vectors, while taking an open-ended outlook towards unknown vulnerabilities. Security teams need to put a symbiotic relationship between domain expertise and data science at the heart of their companies’ defences, to deal with a growing and evolving cybercrime sector.</p>\n<h3>Data science talent</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Advanced%20Electronics/Our%20Insights/How%20artificial%20intelligence%20can%20deliver%20real%20value%20to%20companies/MGI-Artificial-Intelligence-Discussion-paper.ashx\">Research from McKinsey</a> shows that AI uptake is highest among large organisations with the resources to attract top talent. What the consultancy does not state outright is that this includes malicious actors backed by powerful international interests. It is an arms race where first movers can reap exponential rewards.</p>\n<p>Data science remains an emerging field that requires deep technical expertise, and high demand has created a severe talent shortage. <a href=\"http://www.jfgagne.ai/talent?imm_mid=0fb92f&amp;cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_ai_20180219\">One recent report</a> put the global talent pool for AI at just 22,000 individuals, and the number of doctoral students studying the discipline does not indicate an upcoming explosion in supply. Adding to this the cost of salaries and resources, as well as the managerial challenges to integration and inevitable churn, and it is clear that data science often needs to be outsourced to domain experts.</p>\n<p>Data science is an agnostic tool, not a silver bullet or a superweapon. In cybersecurity, where we call it Security Data Science, it can be used to free up analysts’ time, making the security function less operational and more strategic for companies. But it also bolsters threats faced by organisations. AI represents a new paradigm that has the potential to revolutionise the knowledge economy in security and beyond, and security teams need to harness it before the bad guys do.</p>\n<p>Breakthroughs in defence and information technology have always gone hand in hand, from radio to the internet. We are living through an age where Turing’s two intellectual breakthroughs are coming together, except this time it is the machines that are asking questions of humans. Whether building an in-house function or partnering with a domain expert, companies serious about security need to incorporate automation as part of their Security Data Science defence.</p>\n<div class=\"post__tags\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"article__share text-center\"><a class=\"btn bg--facebook btn--icon\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.prevalent.ai/resources/no-one-is-neutral-in-the-data-science-led-cyberwar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"btn__text\"><i class=\"socicon socicon-facebook\"></i>Share on Facebook</span></a></div>\n","databaseId":1635,"date":"2018-03-19T12:13:46","dateGmt":"2018-03-19T12:13:46","desiredSlug":null,"enclosure":null,"excerpt":"<p>Since the second world war, mathematics and warfare have become increasingly intertwined.

This was the first high profile hack of the financial system, the data framework that underpinned the daily transfer of trillions of dollars internationally.</p>\n<p>The FBI worked with Citibank to analyse activity across the accounts that Levin had compromised, manually interrogating the data to trace illegal transfers. The bureau applied its collective intelligence and deep understanding of crime, known as “<a href=\"https://www.prevalent.ai/blogs/tradecraft-putting-the-security-back-into-cybersecurity/\">Tradecraft</a>”, to track and ultimately arrest Levin at London’s Stansted airport. From there, he was extradited to the US to face trial.</p>\n<p>In the two decades since Levin’s court appearance, the business landscape has shifted dramatically. Intellectual property has become the main source of competitive advantage, and now makes up <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/13/companies-failing-see-value-intellectual-property/\">more than half the valuation of the FTSE 100</a>. Businesses have incorporated new innovations such as remote access, employee devices and the cloud, all of which represent new attack vectors for criminals. And cybercrime is now a $1 trillion industry with highly sophisticated actors, even incorporating the resources of nation states.</p>\n<p>While the scale and frequency of attacks has increased dramatically, defence methodology has not kept pace. Modern security analysts often mirror the FBI’s approach in the nineties, manually evaluating thousands of security logs daily, many of which represent false positives. While the tradecraft principles underpinning security are sound, the avalanche of alerts causes fatigue and monopolises analysts’ time, contributing to a shortfall of talent.</p>\n<p>But most importantly, this approach does not scale. Corporate data is growing in size and in strategic significance, creating more vulnerability and risk in the process. Manual data interrogation is not enough to handle current volumes – it’s like asking switchboard operators from the sixties to connect today’s global phone calls.</p>\n<h3>The tools</h3>\n<p>Data has been at the heart of the financial system ever since London’s shipping merchants gathered in Lloyd’s coffee shop to assess the likelihood of their ships’ cargoes landing safely. Since the nineties, widespread access to the internet has led to an exponential rise in the creation of data, bringing data analysis to businesses beyond economists and financiers. Cloud technology has caused the cost of storing data to plummet, and opened up the use of analytics to companies of all sizes.</p>\n<p>The data lakes that were once exclusive to technology companies now help make up the competitive advantage of almost every listed company in the world. This has changed the face of corporate fraud, with <a href=\"https://www.kroll.com/en-us/global-fraud-and-risk-report-2018\">Kroll’s 2018 fraud report</a> showing that information theft has overtaken theft of physical assets for the first time. As breaches become more frequent and more damaging, the skills needed to protect these assets have become a crucial part of an organisation’s risk management.</p>\n<p>But this data also contains the solution to the problem. Just as early insurers looked for patterns in weather conditions to assess the risk to their ships, modern algorithms can analyse data patterns, for example in employees’ behaviour, to determine when something appears out of the ordinary. <a href=\"https://www.prevalent.ai/blogs/no-one-is-neutral-in-the-data-science-led-cyberwar/\">Big data</a> created our current knowledge economy, and also holds the key to protecting it.</p>\n<p>One month prior to Levin’s extradition, another Russian was making history in the US. Garry Kasparov, considered to be the greatest chess player the world has ever seen, also became the first chess grandmaster to lose a match to a computer in tournament conditions. IBM’s Deep Blue drew from data on thousands of masters’ games to identify its every move, an early indication of the data science revolution that lay ahead.</p>\n<p>Since this victory of machine over mind, artificial intelligence has overtaken human expertise in areas from cancer diagnosis to Texas Hold Em. DeepMind’s AlphaGo Zero beat the world’s top chess software after playing against itself for five hours, dispensing with the need for external data of previous matches.</p>\n<p>Following Kasparov’s loss, he discovered that working with an AI of his own, even a basic one, he was able to consistently beat the most powerful AI programmes on the market. This partnership, termed a “centaur”, represents the most advanced chess-playing force on the planet. Combining human domain knowledge with AI computation led to the best possible outcomes.</p>\n<h3>The solution</h3>\n<p>The future of security lies in the convergence of the three strands of big data, artificial intelligence and tradecraft – an evolved approach called Security Data Science. Analysts need to focus on being top level decision makers, rather than subpar data processors, by using their security knowledge to understand possible threats and react appropriately.</p>\n<p>Data scientists must determine the type and amount of data needed to rigorously assess these threats, and ensure it is gathered and analysed correctly. Both can then work together to build tools powered by artificial intelligence that deliver conclusions instead of alerts.</p>\n<p>For any one individual, protecting against today’s advanced cybercriminals can seem like an overwhelming challenge. That is why it requires a collaborative approach. Implementing Security Data Science turns security analysts from players to centaurs. In a business climate where data is king, Security Data Science is becoming the only way for organisations to protect their most precious asset.</p>\n","databaseId":1631,"date":"2018-03-05T09:10:03","dateGmt":"2018-03-05T09:10:03","desiredSlug":null,"enclosure":null,"excerpt":"<p>The Challenge In 1997 Vladimir Levin stood trial for hacking Citibank’s computers to steal over $10 million dollars.
